Code and maps for 2024's 30 Day Map Challenge

This year, I'm completing the 30 Day Map challenge exclusively with the new [__mapgl__ R package](https://walker-data.com/mapgl).  All maps showcase various features of the package and are fully reproducible with the code in this repository as long as you have a Mapbox account.  

You can view the maps at the links here:
